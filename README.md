# IntrusionDectectionSystem
In this project, Intrusions in a networks were attemped to classify using different machine learning model and their results were compared for time and accuracy

## About Dataset
The dataset used here is [KDD Cup 1999 Dataset](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html). The dataset is fairly large consisting of 4.8 million rows and 42 columns including the target column.

## About Code
Different models such as Random forest Classifiers, Decision trees, xgboost, neural networks, Naive bayes were used on 10% of the data to comapare their results, then the best model was used to train on all data and then was evaluated.

### Libraries used 

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. joblib
6. random
7. sklearn
8. tensorflow
